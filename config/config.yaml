# This file is for various variables used throughout the workflow.
# Everything else regarding how things are run should go in the profile config
## Chose Taxonomy approach
## If SINTAX is wanted, set the taxonomy_sintax to true and supply path to sintax formatted database
db_path_sintax: "/databases/midas/MiDAS5.2_20231221/output/FLASVs_w_sintax.fa"
## If Blast taxonomy is wanted, set the taxonomy_blast to true and supply path to blast formatted database
db_path_blast: "/home/bio.aau.dk/mk20aj/databases/MIDAS"
evalue: 1e-10 # E-value cutoff for blast

## Output folders
output_dir: "results"

# input folder is expected to contain a subfolder for each sampleID/barcode
# then all fastq files in each subfolder is concatenated and the folder name is 
# used a sample ID downstream
input_dir: "data/samples/"
tmp_dir: "tmp"
db_path: "/databases/midas/MiDAS5.2_20231221/output/FLASVs_w_sintax.fa"
log_dir: "logs"

# Parameters for filtering reads (filtering.smk)
# Change based on amplicon length and desired quiality
length_lower_limit: 1200 # minimum length of reads to keep
length_upper_limit: 1600 # maximum length of reads to keep
quality_cut_off: 23 # minimum quality score to keep (phred-score)

# Number of threads to use for individual roles.
# Not ideal, but threads can be set in multiple places, so the best is to set 
# this to a large number and instead adjust the max-threads (per rule) 
# in the profile config.yaml to suit your particular computing setup.
max_threads: 32
